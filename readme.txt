Simple but smart and modern Ajax contact form. With Form Blocks and Gutenberg based settings page.

== Description ==

The plugin allows you to add a feedback form or booking form to the page. The data is sent to the server via AJAX (*this can be disabled using the settings and the form will be submitted as usual, with a page reload... but why do you need it?*). You can flexibly personalize the form and its fields.

The form is added to a page using the __Gutenberg Custom Blocks__ - with these blocks, the possibilities for customizing your form are greatly increased.

You can also add a form to a page using the shortcode `[zu-contact]` or `[zu-booking]`.

### Features

* Lightweight `JS script` & `CSS` (only __4 KB__ minified and gzipped)
* Includes form blocks for the new __Gutenberg__ WordPress block editor
* Also supports adding a contact form to any post or page using a shortcode
* Form submission via AJAX (*configurable by settings*)
* Data validation on the server
* Support for required fields
* Responsive layout
* Notification of submissions to default admin or custom email addresses

* Protect submissions from spam with Google `reCAPTCHA` (*configurable by settings*)
* Automatically checks all submissions against global database of spam (with [Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/))
* Save messages to the database as comments to a post or page
* Compatible with the latest version of WordPress

### Gutenberg blocks

With custom blocks for Gutenberg WordPress editor you can easily create new contact forms and customize them with great flexibility:

* You can create a form based on templates or from scratch
* Add and remove form fields
* Change the position of fields, their type and other attributes
* Change field labels, placeholders and validation error messages
* Add to verification form using Google `reCAPTCHA`
* Change the animation of the form loader (used during form submission)

### Shortcode attributes

You can also personalize the form by adding attributes to the shortcode:

* __class__ - Change CSS class of form: `class="my-contact-form"`
* __form__ - Select one of preloaded forms: `form="contact"`
* __subheading__ - Change form subheading: `subheading="My Contact Form"`
* __ajax__ - Disable form submission via AJAX: `ajax=false`
* __recaptcha__ - Disable Google reCAPTCHA widget: `recaptcha=false`
* __rows__ - Change rows amount in textarea: `rows=12`
* __message__ - Set predefined form message: `message="Thanks for your hard work!"`

#### Examples

* With custom subheading and without reCAPTCHA:

`[zu-contact subheading="My Contact Form" recaptcha=false]`

* With custom class, without AJAX and with 8 rows in textarea:

`[zu-contact class="my-contact-form" ajax=false rows=8]`
